##Project Summary
**Overview:** Assuming an autonomously operating solar microgrid, predict future electrical load demand by the system the microgrid produces for
**Motivation:** Solar power is not consistently generated.  In order to reliably meed demand, power must be output to meet immediate demand or stored for future use.  The system that decides which to do require a reliable prediction of future demand for power
**Problem:** Given a time and current demand, develop a model that accurately predicts the future electrical demand
